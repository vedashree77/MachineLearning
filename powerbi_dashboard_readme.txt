Customer churn is one of the most critical metrics in the telecom industry, as the cost of acquiring new customers often far exceeds the cost of retaining existing ones. This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to identify patterns and reasons behind churn.

The goal of this project is to build an interactive, professional-grade Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into customer retention, subscription preferences, and spending habits.


Through this project, I have demonstrated the ability to:

Clean and structure "messy" telecom data for analysis.

Develop a structured data model.

Design a user-friendly dashboard that follows data visualization best practices.

Translate complex data into clear business insights.
